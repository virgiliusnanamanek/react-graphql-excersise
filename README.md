 # React x GraphQL

This is a simple example of how to use GraphQL with React.

## How to run

First, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash

npm install

```

Then, you need to run the server:

```bash

npm run server

```

Finally, you can run the client:

```bash

npm run client

```

## How to use

The client is a simple React app that uses Apollo Client to fetch data from the server.

The server is a simple GraphQL server that uses github.com/graphql-go/graphql to define the schema and github.com/graphql-go/handler to handle the requests.
